                <h2>Abuot Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Ahmed Fouda, I'm 20 years old, I'm studying at faculty of Engineering
                    Mechatronics department, from a short while ago I was sitting with my best friend
                    and we had a small talk about our dreams and problems in our life. That one of the most
                    opportunities
                    that I won't forgot and I'll be grateful for it for whole my life, when we talked about Elzero web
                    school
                    channel and the playlists on it, and one of them was Python playlist that was new then.
                    And without any intoductions I had decided to learn Python, for what I don't know,
                    all I knew was that I was so excited for it.
                </p>
                <p>This journey of learning started from 3 monthes ago, I have put a plan for myself,
                    by the next July 2021 I hope achieve all I have planned, one of the most imprtant plans is to have a
                    job
                    and start my independent journey.</p>

                <p>For three monthes there are the skills I gained,
                    Pyhton as a programming language, Django as a frame work for web development with Pyhton,
                    SQL the language of dealing with data base, and HTML/CSS the basics techniques of web design,
                    and there are some other skils like typing 50 wpm on the keyboard without looking, and command line,
                    and Git&Github.
                </p>

                <p>All These skills I've learned will be an extra extinsion for me in the future, because they are not
                    the main science I learn,
                    you know they are beside Mechatronics engineering that I intend to join the master degree in Germany
                    God willing.

                <h2>My Education</h2>
                <p>From 3 years ago I watched a movie that called "3 Idiots", this movie had a big influence on me
                    because the hero of it "Ranshordas Shamldas Chanshad"
                    this guy who inspired me because of his principles and great ideas, and one of the most scence that
                    I loved in this movie was the school scene, when he decided to teach the children although he was a
                    big scientist and the big companies were compete on him.
                    so what I want to say is we have the same man here in Egypt, the great "Osama Elzero", all I
                    learned, all I'm in in this second is thanks to this man after allah.
                    actually I discovered my passion because of this man, and when you find your passion you should be
                    grateful as the lucky people who do.
                </p>
                <p>In "Elzero web school" channl I spent my hours, I learned all of these techniques there, and I'm so
                    gratfull for this great opportunity.</p>
